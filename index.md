# **Conditional Formatting**
 Faith Meyer

## **What am I talking about?**
In this tutorial I will be talking about the Excel tool called Conditional Formatting. This is one of the tools to help you organize your data. It will also help you visualize the range of your data in a different way than just creating a graph or sorting your data. Conditional Formatting is a tool that can look at the full range of your data and color code it in whatever color scheme you would like. There are plenty of other ways it can be used such as for creating macros and formatting your data in different ways. 

## **Why would I use Conditional Formatting?**
Conditional Formatting is a very useful tool for many different things. Like I said earlier, conditional formatting is a tool that can be used to visualize the full range of your data. It will color code your data however you want it. The example I created has to do with temperatures. We will look at the example closer later on in this tutorial. The great thing about this tool is there are many different ways you can organize your data. You could order the cells by value, based on what they contain, the top and bottom values to just name a few. You can also decide how you want the data to be represented. You can choose to have a two or three color scheme, change the way the bars appear in a bar, or change the icons that are being shown to represent the data.
